# LEETCODE-Array-1863
The provided Java solution for the problem of finding the sum of all subset XOR totals is clever and concise, leveraging bitwise operations and streams. However, it would benefit from a detailed explanation to understand why and how it works. Let's go through the logic step by step.

### Problem Explanation
The task is to find the sum of the XOR of all subsets of a given array of integers.

### Code Explanation

1. **Combining All Elements with Bitwise OR**:
   ```java
   Arrays.stream(nums).reduce((a, b) -> a | b).getAsInt()
   ```
   This part of the code uses Java Streams to reduce the array `nums` by combining all elements using the bitwise OR operator (`|`). The result is a single integer where each bit is set if it was set in any of the original numbers. This combined value (`A | B | C | ...`) represents the maximum possible value any XOR of subsets could have.

2. **Shifting Left by `nums.length - 1`**:
   ```java
   << nums.length - 1
   ```
   The shift operation is used here because the sum of the XOR of all subsets can be expressed as this combined OR value times `2^(n-1)`, where `n` is the length of the array. This accounts for the fact that each bit position in the combined OR value contributes to `2^(n-1)` subsets, as each bit can either be included or excluded independently across the subsets.

### Full Solution Code
Here's the same code with added comments for clarity:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int subsetXORSum(int[] nums) {
        // Combine all elements using bitwise OR
        int combinedOrValue = Arrays.stream(nums).reduce((a, b) -> a | b).getAsInt();
        // Each bit in combinedOrValue contributes to 2^(nums.length - 1) subsets
        return combinedOrValue << (nums.length - 1);
    }
}
```

### Example Dry Run
Consider an example array: `[1, 3]`.

1. **Bitwise OR Reduction**:
   - Initial values: `1` (binary `01`) and `3` (binary `11`).
   - Result of `1 | 3` is `3` (binary `11`), as each bit is set if it is set in either number.

2. **Left Shift**:
   - The array has 2 elements, so we shift left by `2 - 1 = 1`.
   - The result of `3 << 1` is `6` (binary `110`).

### Output
Thus, the output for the example `[1, 3]` is `6`.

This solution efficiently calculates the sum of all subset XOR totals using bitwise operations and stream reduction, which is both concise and performant for this problem.
